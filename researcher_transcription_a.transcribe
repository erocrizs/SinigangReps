    [00:55] Researcher_A
    OK hi, um, we're going to ask Mr. Williams what to do now.
	
	[01:07] Researcher_B
	Mr. Williams, what do we do now?
	
	[01:12] Researcher_A
	Clicked the button and it's lagging!
	
	[01:13] Researcher_B
	It's so slow.
	
	[01:15] Researcher_A
	And here!
	
	[01:16] Researcher_B
	OK, "it's a good strategy to quiz Stacy because it will help you to understand what Stacy already knows." So, do we go here in the Quiz button or do we stay here in the Stacy window?
	
	[01:30] Researcher_B
	Oh he's so informative! "Go to the Quiz tab and click the Quiz button." [giggle]
	
	[01:35] Researcher_A
	OK!
	
	[01:36] Researcher_B
	OK!
	
	[01:37] Researcher_A
	Thank you, Mr. Williams
	
	[01:37] Researcher_B
	And it's also slow... Quiz...
	
	[01:43] Researcher_A
	For the meantime, let's talk about politics. [laughter]
	
	[01:44] Researcher_B
	Oh wow! [snicker] This is on record so we probably shouldn't!
	
	[01:50] Researcher_A
	[laughter]
	
	[01:51] Researcher_B
	Baka arrested tayo ng mga ka-DDS. [laughter]
	
	[01:53] Researcher_A
	OK! [Laughter]
	
	[01:55] Researcher_B
	Dapat iyan na lang yaong pangalan ni Stacy. Ka-DDS!
	
	[01:57] Researcher_A
	Si Mocha. [Laughter]
	
	[01:59] Researcher_B
	Hindi, ka-DDS nga! Totoo ba ito mga ka-DDS?
	
	[02:06] Researcher_A
	OK, Take quiz.
	
	[02:06] Researcher_B
	Ok, quiz na.
	
	[02:07] Researcher_A
	Stacy is going to take the quiz now and let's see how she does.
	
	[02:12] Researcher_B
	So do we just, like, wait for -- ah OK so parang ipa-process lang niya.
	
	[02:17] Researcher_A
	Yeah.
	
	[02:18] Researcher_A
	We are going to see how good she is at doing algebra.
	
	[02:21] Researcher_B
	Yeah, ang cute may mga expressions siya like shifty eyes and stuff.
	
	[02:28] Researcher_A
	She looks worried.
	
	[02:29] Researcher_B
	Yeah, she's not very confident in this quiz.
	
	[02:34] Researcher_A
	She's stuck in quiz problem number one.
	
	[02:36] Researcher_B
	Either that or it's hanging. [laughter] huh.
	
	[02:41] Researcher_A
	I think it's simulating it. The length...
	
	[02:43] Researcher_B
	Actually I -- uy!
	
	[02:46] Researcher_B
	"I've graded Stacy's quiz on one step equations. An excellent job" -- wow I'm so proud of her we didn't even teach her yet. "Her problem was completed correctly. Move on to the next quiz. Click" -- then, oh typo -- "quiz button." Click it.
	
	[03:05] Researcher_A
	OK I clicked it and...
	
	[03:06] Researcher_B 
	She's working on quiz problem -- so one problem each lang yaong quiz? [giggle]
	
	[03:12] Researcher_A
	Oh, may number two pa pala. So yeah.
	
	[03:14] Researcher_B
	Uy! Wow ang bilis!
	
	[03:19] Researcher_A
	I forgot we can code switch.
	
	[03:22] Researcher_B
	Oo! Kanina pa ako nagtatagalog.
	
	[03:25] Researcher_A
	Nalimutan ko eh.
	
	[03:27] Researcher_B
	[Laughter] Will translate namin eh. Kaya pala ang awkward mo.
	
	[03:33] Researcher_B
	Ah, tatlo yung problems dito.
	
	[03:35] Researcher_B
	Yeah.
	
	[03:37] Researcher_B
	"Quiz again." "I've graded Stacy's quiz on two step equations. None of the problems were right this time." You had one job.
	
	[03:46] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]
	
	[03:46] Researcher_B
	"Click the Stacy tab to go back to tutoring." Ano tutor ba tayo -- oh yeah you have -- you can't take the next quiz  now until she finishes those.
	
	[03:52] Researcher_A
	Yeah.
	
	[03:55] Researcher_B
	OK, so...
	
	[03:56] Researcher_A
	We can look at where she did wrong and...
	
	[03:59] Researcher_B
	Ah OK, uh, narrate na lang kaya natin yung mali niya.
	
	[04:04] Researcher_A
	So, yaong mali kasi, three V plus sev -- three V plus two is equal to seven. And yaong step na ginawa niya is add three.
	
	[04:14] Researcher_B
	Yeah...
	
	[04:15] Researcher_A
	And that's not the right step.
	
	[04:17] Researcher_B
	That's wrong. We have to go tutor her!
	
	[04:21] Researcher_A
	Second problem.
	
	[04:22] Researcher_B
	Bakit siya --
	
	[04:22] Researcher_A
	She didn't even bother answering it.
	
	[04:26] Researcher_B
	Ah OK.  Same! [Laughter] I know nothing. Not in Algebra.
	
	[04:28] Researcher_A
	Let's go to Stacy. What -- OK.
	
	[04:31] Researcher_B
	OK. Clicked the Stacy tab
	
	[04:34] Researcher_A
	And it's loading, ish.
	
	[04:36] Researcher_B
	Kaya mo iyan! Kayang kaya mo yan --
	
	[04:40] Researcher_A
	OK, uh, yeah.
	
	[04:42] Researcher_B
	Ah.
	
	[04:42] Researcher_A
	We're now in Stacy tab and Stacy is asking us if we pick her next problem.
	
	[04:50] Researcher_B
	Do we give her the problem from the quiz?
	
	[04:52] Researcher_A
	Huh.
	
	[04:54] Researcher_B
	Yeah?
	
	[04:55] Researcher_A
	Maybe.
	
	[04:56] Researcher_B
	OK.
	
	[04:57] Researcher_A
	Three V -- three X -- three V plus...
	
	[04:59] Researcher_B
	Three V plus two, right?
	
	[05:02] Researcher_A
	equals seven.
	
	[05:02] Researcher_B
	equals seven.
	
	[05:08] Researcher_B
	[hum]... OK. Equals seven.
	
	[05:08] Researcher_A
	Yeah.
	
	[05:09] Researcher_B
	And then...
	
	[05:09] Researcher_A
	"Is this how you wanted the problem?" Yes Stacy!
	
	[05:11] Researcher_B
	Oh OK.
	
	[05:15] Researcher_A
	Please answer that for us.
	
	[05:20] Researcher_A
	I'm not sure if I clicked it.
	
	[05:21] Researcher_B
	Yeah.
	
	[05:22] Researcher_A
	Yeah I clicked it.
	
	[05:23] Researcher_B
	Me, "Yes".
	
	[05:26] Researcher_B
	Go Stacy!
	
	[05:28] Researcher_B
	Is she going to solve it?
	
	[05:30] Researcher_A
	"OK, let me think. Bear with me," Stacy said.
	
	[05:37] Researcher_B
	OK, ang cute ni Stacy.
	
	[05:39] Researcher_A
	Yeah, question marks.
	
	[05:40] Researcher_B
	"I think I should enter 'add three' in the transformation. Am I right?" No!

	[05:46] Researcher_A
	[Giggle]
	
	[05:46] Researcher_B
	That was your mistake in the quiz. At least consistent! [giggle]
	
	[05:49] Researcher_B
	"No."
	
	[05:49] Researcher_A
	"No."
	
	[05:53] Researcher_B
	"No."
	
	[05:56] Researcher_B
	Wow, this is really slow. [giggle]
	
	[05:58] Researcher_B
	"OK, my bad." Aw, what graceful loser.
	
	[06:01] Researcher_A
	[Laughter] salbahe!
	
	[06:05] Researcher_B
	[Laughter]
	
	[06:08] Researcher_B
	Hum. "Then I'll enter 'divide three' in the transformation. Does that sound OK?"
	
	[06:13] Researcher_A
	"No."
	
	[06:14] Researcher_B
	"No." Not yet.
	
	[06:21] Researcher_B
	"No." [Laughter]
	
	[06:22] Researcher_A
	[Laughter] It take so much time, I swear!
	
	[06:25] Researcher_B
	Parang 'Zootopia' lang, as in yaong sloth part.
	
	[06:30] Researcher_A
	"Oops OK. So 'divide three' is wrong. Can you show me how to do..."
	
	[06:34] Researcher_B
	"... what to do here? I'm stuck."
	
	[06:36] Researcher_A
	<Researcher_B>, what should she do?
	
	[06:36] Researcher_B
	I'm glad you asked! You have to subtract two.
	
	[06:40] Researcher_B
	Ikaw ba will type? Ako?
	
	[06:42] Researcher_A
	Ako -- ikaw na.
	
	[06:43] Researcher_B
	[Laughter] labo.
	
	[06:45] Researcher_B
	Subtract two. Do I press enter or -- enter ba?
	
	[06:49] Researcher_A
	Enter.
	
	[06:52] Researcher_B
	OK, so it's -- feels -- looks kinda hanging so I guess that's right. [Laughter]
	
	[06:56] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]
	
	[06:57] Researcher_A
	She's thinking.
	
	[06:59] Researcher_B
	[Giggle] Ang awkward nito.
	
	[07:02] Researcher_B
	"OK, let me think. Bear with me." "Hm let me think, bear with me."
	
	[07:08] Researcher_A
	Why do you have a bear with you?
	
	[07:10] Researcher_B
	"I'm not quite sure how to 'subtract two' here. I'm stuck. Can you show me?" [giggle]
	
	[07:18] Researcher_A
	Three v plus two minus two is equal to...
	
	[07:19] Researcher_B
	I can't believe she got to Algebra but she doesn't know arithmetic. [Laughter]
	
	[07:24] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]
	
	[07:25] Researcher_B
	OK. Fine, I'm sorry I'm that kind of person, I guess. Identified ko na kung yaong social move ko. [Laughter]
	
	[07:36] Researcher_B
	Oh my God I'm going to hate listening to this.
	
	[07:38] Researcher_A
	OK, three V...
	
	[07:39] Researcher_B
	Three V equals...

	[07:41] Researcher_A
	Enter.
	
	[07:42] Researcher_B
	Do I just need -- OK.
	
	[07:49] Researcher_B
	"OK. Let me think. Bear with me."
	
	[07:54] Researcher_B
	Kaya mo iyan!
	
	[07:54] Researcher_A
	She's thinking about the seven. 
	
	[07:56] Researcher_B
	Kaya mo iyan. You can do it.
	
	[07:59] Researcher_A
	Maybe she knows how to subtract two from seven, right?
	
	[08:00] Researcher_B
	I hope so.
		
	[08:02] Researcher_B
	"I know I'm supposed to subtract two here but I don't know how. I'm stuck. Please show me what to do." Goddamnit Stacy.
	
	[08:11] Researcher_A
	<Researcher_B>, show it!
	
	[08:13] Researcher_B
	I don't know how to subtract two from seven either. Five? Maybe? Tapos ako pala yaong mali.
	
	[08:25] Researcher_B
	"OK, let me think. Bear with me." Anything for you, Stacy.
	
	[08:33] Researcher_B
	"Let's see, [mispronunciation] bear with me while I think."
	
	[08:45] Researcher_B
	"Is it OK to say that the problem is solved here?"
	
	[08:48] Researcher_A
	"No."
	
	[08:48] Researcher_B
	"No."
	
	[08:50] Researcher_B
	"No."
	
	[08:54] Researcher_B
	"No." [Laughter]
	
	[08:56] Researcher_A
	Sorry, Stacy, but it's not done.
	
	[08:56] Researcher_B
	Not quite but you -- so the --
	
	[08:59] Researcher_B
	"Hm, so problem is not done. Let's see."
	
	[09:02] Researcher_B
	Huh? Bakit nawala -- ah OK.
	
	[09:07] Researcher_A
	She's not checking the...
	
	[09:07] Researcher_B
	"I don't know what to do here. I'm stuck. Could you please show me?" You were right there, Stacy! You were doing it earlier but OK.
	
	[09:12] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]
	
	[09:14] Researcher_A
	I think she were -- masiyado siyang advanced.
	
	[09:16] Researcher_B
	Oo nga eh. Masyadong excited.
	
	[09:18] Researcher_A
	'Divide three.' Iyan. 
	
	[09:19] Researcher_B
	Yes, [mispronunciation] divide.
	
	[09:22] Researcher_A
	Tama naman, 'di ba, yaong grammar?
	
	[09:24] Researcher_B
	[Affirming hum]
	
	[09:24] Researcher_A
	[Snicker] It's just weird.
	
	[09:26] Researcher_B
	Ano kaya yaong mangyayari if you put a not valid, uh...
	
	[09:30] Researcher_A
	Do you want to try it? You might accidentally break the SimStudent.
	
	[09:33] Researcher_B
	Mamaya na lang, after. I'm curious what they can -- ano -- dividing three or something.
	
	[09:40] Researcher_A
	"Hm, let me think. Bear with me."
	
	[09:45] Researcher_B
	"Well, let me think, bear with me."
	
	[09:48] Researcher_A
	Bakit dalawang beses?
	
	[09:50] Researcher_B
	Siguro para every certain...
	
	[09:55] Researcher_B
	Pero nasaan na?
	
	[09:57] Researcher_A
	No! It's not yet solved!
	
	[09:58] Researcher_B
	Nasaan na yaong answer niya?
	
	[09:59] Researcher_A
	Hindi nga niya revealed eh.
	
	[10:01] Researcher_B
	Context. Three -- three v equals five, and then 'divide three' under transformation, and then there is nothing in the next row for equation and she's like "the problem is solved. Do you think that is right?" No! It's not! Where's the... You have to divide it, girl!
	
	[10:20] Researcher_A
	Yeah.
	
	[10:21] Researcher_B
	Or is it just not showing up? No, no, no, it's not.
	
	[10:23] Researcher_A
	Hindi, dapat hindi pa, kasi -- she would --
	
	[10:26] Researcher_B
	Surely, she would put it, right?
	
	[10:28] Researcher_A
	Yeah, and she would ask us for confirmation if tama yaong division niya by three.
	
	[10:33] Researcher_B
	Yeah. Ang labo.
	
	[10:37] Researcher_A
	"No."
	
	[10:42] Researcher_B
	"Oh, I understand clicking 'The Problem is Solved' button is wrong here. Let me think." Go Stacy, Go.

	[10:50] Researcher_B
	"I know I'm supposed to 'divide three' here, but I don't know how. I'm stuck. Please show me what to do."
	
	[10:57] Researcher_B
	Grabe she aced the one step equation. [laughter] 
	
	[11:00] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]
	
	[11:01] Researcher_B
	Isang step na lang eh.
	
	[11:03] Researcher_A
	So three v divided by three is?
	
	[11:06] Researcher_B
	v equals -- uh, do we just put v?
	
	[11:12] Researcher_A
	Yeah. She's just asking for this -- for the left hand side of the equation.
	
	[11:15] Researcher_B
	Ah sabagay.
	
	[11:18] Researcher_B
	"Well let me think, bear with me." You go, girl. Go Stacy.
	
	[11:27] Researcher_B
	"Let's see. Bear with me while I think."
	
	[11:34] Researcher_A
	Why does she have to ask every single thing she did?
	
	[11:38] Researcher_B
	Because she's insecure.
	
	[11:40] Researcher_A
	Don't know what for.
	
	[11:41] Researcher_B
	Wow galing! 
	
	[11:42] Researcher_A
	Oh, she knows how to divide by -- five by three!
	
	[11:45] Researcher_B
	Wow! She's so smart! "I thought it would be good to enter five over three on the right hand side. Does that sound okay?"
	
	[11:53] Researcher_A
	Yes!
	
	[11:53] Researcher_B
	Yes!
	
	[11:55] Researcher_B
	Yay! This is, like, the first yes we've given her.
	
	[12:02] Researcher_B
	"Yes."
	
	[12:03] Researcher_B
	"So let me think. Bear with me."
	
	[12:06] Researcher_A
	More like "bore with me." Ooh!
	
	[12:10] Researcher_B
	Ooh! Nice "bear"n. [laughter]
	
	[12:12] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]
	
	[12:17] Researcher_B
	[Laughter] galing natin think-aloud [laughter]
	
	[12:22] Researcher_A
	Ano ba. [Laughter]
	
	[12:23] Researcher_B
	I -- I -- I'm really con -- is -- uh "Is it okay to that the problem is solved here?"
	
	[12:29] Researcher_A
	Yes!
	
	[12:29] Researcher_B
	Yes!
	
	[12:30] Researcher_A
	The second 'Yes'.
	
	[12:32] Researcher_B
	The second 'Yes'. [giggle]
	
	[12:33] Researcher_B
	Si <redacted> tahimik lang, trying not to laugh. [laughter] Mukha niya [giggle]
	
	[12:42] Researcher_B
	"OK, done. What are we doing next? Mr. Willaims might have a suggestion if you're not sure."
	
	[12:48] Researcher_A
	Do we ask Mr. Williams or do we -- are we strong and independent men and women?
	
	[12:53] Researcher_B
	I guess we can ask Mr. Williams?

	[12:56] Researcher_A
	Sige. Asking Mr. Williams "what should I do next?"

	[13:00] Researcher_B
	"What should I do next?"

	[13:04] Researcher_B
	"Stacy has had some practice on the failed quiz problem. It would be good to see if Stacy can solve it now. Tell me more."

	[13:14] Researcher_B
	"Click the quiz cab -- cav -- tab and click the quiz button."

	[13:17] Researcher_A
	So should we let her take the quiz again?

	[13:20] Researcher_B
	I guess? Yeah 'cause she didn't -- barely got to the second one so maybe we can -- we'll have to see did that -- if she will do that right after...

	[13:27] Researcher_A
	Oh look there's a problem bank.

	[13:29] Researcher_B
	Saan? Oh.

	[13:31] Researcher_A
	What's in here? I'll click it.

	[13:33] Researcher_B
	OK.

	[13:34] Researcher_A
	And...

	[13:35] Researcher_B
	It passed me. Huh. "Here's the problems you can..."

	[13:37] Researcher_A
	Oh.

	[13:40] Researcher_B
	Oh OK. That's interesting.

	[13:42] Researcher_A
	OK, describe -- context. What we see is a table, um, it's a list of problems for Stacy. Uh, it's categorized according to the number of steps it takes, and there's also difficuty rating on how much difficult the problem will be. Uy puwede kaya -- puwedeng nasa right side yaong variable.

	[14:04] Researcher_B
	Oh interesting.

	[14:06] Researcher_A
	'Di ba?

	[14:07] Researcher_B
	I'm -- I'm interested here, that x minus seven plus three. Do you think we'd have to show -- do you think we'd have to make her join the constants first?

	[14:16] Researcher_A
	Oo nga, no?

	[14:20] Researcher_A
	It's a two-step, so...

	[14:26] Researcher_A
	I don't know...  Yeah it's two-step, technically. Sige, tara, tara, let's try it.

	[14:31] Researcher_B
	Want to try it? X minus seven plus three equals five.

	[14:35] Researcher_A
	We're trying that on Stacy. If she can answer that, then we'll have her take the quiz again.

	[14:42] Researcher_B
	Do you really have to -- ah, new problem, OK. That's how we do it.

	[14:48] Researcher_A
	New problem.

	[14:48] Researcher_B
	OK, new problem. What is that? X minus...

	[14:52] Researcher_A
	Three plus seven.

	[14:54] Researcher_B
	Was it "x minus three plus seven" or is it "x minus seven plus three?"

	[14:56] Researcher_A
	I -- I guess it doesn't matter.

	[14:57] Researcher_B
	Yeah we just want to know if...

	[14:57] Researcher_A
	It's just the nature of the problem.

	[15:03] Researcher_A
	Huh.

	[15:04] Researcher_B
	Ah wait.

	[15:05] Researcher_A
	She's kind of not responding.

	[15:07] Researcher_B
	I fee -- I feel like I remember the introduction video saying like, um, baka sa problem bank you can click on the problem itself and then watch how they solved it so we can see if we would have to, um, if we would have to join the constants first. Can you try? Will the...

	[15:27] Researcher_A
	[interrupting] I -- I didn't think -- that's a good idea. But I, uh -- tignan natin. Huh. Click natin?

	[15:35] Researcher_B
	Yeah. Yeah. No?

	[15:38] Researcher_A
	No. Hindi siya clickable eh.

	[15:40] Researcher_B
	Baka sa examples.

	[15:42] Researcher_A
	Baka sa examples nga.

	[15:48] Researcher_A
	Checking out the examples tab.

	[15:54] Researcher_B
	Hm. Nope.

	[15:55] Researcher_A
	Wala eh.

	[15:56] Researcher_B
	Ay!

	[15:57] Researcher_A
	No, it's not here.

	[15:57] Researcher_B
	Ay hindi. Not that.

	[15:59] Researcher_A
	So yeah, let's just test it with her.

	[16:02] Researcher_B
	Alright. I guess we'll try.

	[16:06] Researcher_B
	Ano nga ba? X...

	[16:08] Researcher_A
	X...

	[16:09] Researcher_B
	Minus...

	[16:10] Researcher_A
	Minus...

	[16:12] Researcher_B
	Seven...

	[16:13] Researcher_A
	Seven...

	[16:13] Researcher_B
	Plus three?

	[16:15] Researcher_A
	Plus three is equal to five.

	[16:16] Researcher_B
	Equal to five.

	[16:20] Researcher_A
	Five.

	[16:25] Researcher_A
	"Will this..."

	[16:25] Researcher_B
	"Will this problem help me do better in the quiz next time?"

	[16:29] Researcher_A
	Hopefully.

	[16:30] Researcher_B
	I guess?

	[16:35] Researcher_B
	In hindsight, dapat nilagyan natin ng coefficient yaong x. Oh well!

	[16:40] Researcher_A
	But that would be four steps already.

	[16:43] Researcher_B
	I don't think -- it has to be two.

	[16:43] Researcher_A
	Three steps pala.

	[16:45] Researcher_B
	Oh OK, fine.

	[16:49] Researcher_A
	Huh. I'm not sure if I clicked it.

	[16:49] Researcher_B
	Kayang kaya mo iyan!

	[16:51] Researcher_B
	I think you did. It's, uh, kinda hangy so I guess that's right.

	[17:02] Researcher_B
	"Yes." [laughter]

	[17:03] Researcher_A
	[laughter]

	[17:06] Researcher_B
	Gusto ko ng coke.

	[17:11] Researcher_A
	[Snicker]

	[17:11] Researcher_B
	Ano!

	[17:12] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]

	[17:12] Researcher_B
	Bakit ka natatawa?

	[17:15] Researcher_A
	It's sounds like you want drugs. Yaong coccaine. [laughter]

	[17:16] Researcher_B
	[Laughter] Grabe. My God! I hate drugs.

	[17:22] Researcher_B
	"Let's see, bear with me while I think."

	[17:26] Researcher_B
	"Subtract three..." Ah, OK that's how you do it.

	[17:32] Researcher_A
	Yeah.

	[17:33] Researcher_B
	OK.

	[17:34] Researcher_A
	Well I...

	[17:35] Researcher_B
	[interrupting] I mean...

	[17:36] Researcher_A
	[interrupting]There's -- there's not any command that says...

	[17:38] Researcher_B
	[interrupting] Oo nga eh.

	[17:39] Researcher_A
	"Merge Constants"

	[17:40] Researcher_B
	That's true! That's true. OK, fine.

	[17:43] Researcher_B
	"Would it be good to enter 'subtact three' in the transformation?" Yeah.

	[17:49] Researcher_A
	Yeah.

	[17:50] Researcher_B
	"Yes."

	[17:50] Researcher_A
	Ay! Sorry. [Snicker]

	[17:52] Researcher_B
	[Laughter]

	[17:58] Researcher_B
	Ang saya nito. [Laughter] Fun! This will be the fun part of our thesis.

	[18:05] Researcher_A
	Huh.

	[18:06] Researcher_B
	This week and next, we're going to cry na.

	[18:08] Researcher_A
	Are you sure it's still recording?

	[18:10] Researcher_B
	[Affirming hum]

	[18:14] Researcher_B
	Yeah it is.

	[18:18] Researcher_B
	"So I thought it would be good to enter 'x minus seven' in the left-hand side. Does that sound OK?"

	[18:24] Researcher_A
	Yes.

	[18:24] Researcher_B
	Yes.

	[18:27] Researcher_B
	"Yes."

	[18:28] Researcher_B
	Uy, mas mabilis yaong...

	[18:30] Researcher_A
	After this, maybe we should...

	[18:31] Researcher_B
	Quiz her?

	[18:32] Researcher_A
	Yeah. We should quiz her.

	[18:33] Researcher_B
	Yeah. So we can see her mistake, if ever, sa next problem.

	[18:41] Researcher_B
	"Subract three..." oh yeah.

	[18:46] Researcher_B
	"I think it's a good move to enter 'two' in the right-hand side. Do you agree?"

	[18:51] Researcher_B
	Yes.

	[18:51] Researcher_A
	Yes.

	[18:57] Researcher_B
	[Snicker] Pinanindigin -- pina [mispronunciation] -- i don't know how to tagalog. We really stuck with 'Stacy.'

	[19:04] Researcher_B
	"OK, let me think. Bear with me."

	[19:05] Researcher_A
	Siya na si Stacy eh.

	[19:07] Researcher_B
	Sanay na tayo sa 'Stacy' eh.

	[19:09] Researcher_A
	The black, strong, independent woman.

	[19:11] Researcher_B
	It's like Annie, but...

	[19:13] Researcher_A
	Yeah. [Giggle]

	[19:14] Researcher_B
	[Giggle] Yaong latest movie ng Annie. [Laughter]

	[19:19] Researcher_A
	Huh, "do you think it's good to divide seven here?" she said.

	[19:23] Researcher_B
	Huh? No?

	[19:25] Researcher_A
	Sorry, no.

	[19:26] Researcher_B
	No.

	[19:26] Researcher_A
	'x minus seven' you do -- should -- you're not supposed to divide seven. You're supposed to do something else.

	[19:31] Researcher_B
	"No."

	[19:33] Researcher_A
	I said 'No', hindi ba?

	[19:34] Researcher_B
	Yeah.

	[19:34] Researcher_A
	OK.

	[19:35] Researcher_B
	"Oh, I understand 'divide seven' is wrong here."

	[19:37] Researcher_A
	Then you shouldn't have said it was.

	[19:39] Researcher_B
	[Laughter] Sass! Sass master!

	[19:41] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]

	[19:44] Researcher_B
	"I don't know what to do here. I'm stuck. Could you please show me? I'm not good at -- at arithmetic at all." [laughter] Add seven, you fool!

	[19:53] Researcher_A
	[Giggle]

	[19:54] Researcher_B
	Grabe buti na lang hindi pa namin quized.

	[19:59] Researcher_A
	I thought you were going to say a -- profanity.

	[20:01] Researcher_B
	Ano?!

	[20:04] Researcher_A
	I wish I  --

	[20:05] Researcher_B
	[interrupting] Do i...

	[20:05] Researcher_A
	[interrupting] are we allowed to speak profanity?

	[20:08] Researcher_B
	It's not like we're high school teachers telling them not to swear. I'm pretty sure kasama din iyan sa -- like

	[20:18] Researcher_A
	[interrupting] So pwede?

	[20:19] Researcher_B
	[interrupting] -- may mga insults naman sa social moves -- speech acts.

	[20:23] Researcher_A
	About how you can swear at it.

	[20:26] Researcher_B
	Yeah.

	[20:28] Researcher_A
	So, puwede magmura?

	[20:28] Researcher_B
	"I think it's a good move --" yeah I guess so.

	[20:31] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]

	[20:32] Researcher_A
	"I think it's a good move to enter 'x' in the left-hand side. Do you agree?" X minus seven plus seven is seven. Ay -- I mean x. Wait what?

	[20:39] Researcher_B
	Wait what? [laughter]

	[20:39] Researcher_A
	X! X yaong nasa left-hand side, sige.

	[20:43] Researcher_B
	Yes, yes, yes.

	[20:43] Researcher_A
	"Do you agree?" Yes.

	[20:45] Researcher_B
	Napapa-isip din ako eh [giggle]. Aloud. Hahaha [Laughter]

	[20:49] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]

	[20:56] Researcher_A
	Oh my --

	[20:56] Researcher_B
	I'm sorry.

	[20:57] Researcher_A
	I -- I -- now that I am experiencing -- I'm actually doing the experiment, I think deserve talaga nila yaong 40 dollar. [giggle] this is hard.

	[21:07] Researcher_B
	Yeah, pero...

	[21:07] Researcher_A
	[interrupting] Usually, kapag walang kasama, mas lalo siya...

	[21:10] Researcher_B
	[interrupting] It's really hard kapag mag-isa, puwede naman -- when you have someone to talk to, parang...

	[21:14] Researcher_A
	[interrupting] It's chll.

	[21:14] Researcher_B
	mas chill.

	[21:15] Researcher_A
	Yeah -- "Is it OK to enter 9 in the right hand side now?"

	[21:18] Researcher_B
	Yeah! Yes, yes, yes!

	[21:19] Researcher_A
	Yes. OK.

	[21:21] Researcher_B
	Yes, magaling mag-arithmetic.

	[21:23] Researcher_A
	Marunong na siyang mag-add, subtract -- she learned from us. We taught her --

	[21:27] Researcher_B
	[interrupting] Yeah

	[21:28] Researcher_A
	-- how to add seven!

	[21:29] Researcher_B
	[giggle] when she -- [giggle] -- when she finds the cure for cancer in the future, she'll have us to thank. [giggle]

	[21:36] Researcher_A
	[Laughter]

	[21:47] Researcher_A
	"Is it OK to say that the problem is solved here?"

	[21:49] Researcher_B
	Yes.

	[21:50] Researcher_A
	Yes. OK, let's quiz her.

	[21:52] Researcher_B
	Yeah.

	[21:52] Researcher_A
	Let's quiz her.

	[22:01] Researcher_B
	"Great! The problem is solved!"
