    And its not responding. Kuya, does this really take long?
    
    [00:10] Volunteer_1
    Yeah ganyan talaga. Kunwari kasi nag-iisip si Stacy.
    
    [00:12] Student_B
    Oh so simulating niya yaong time it takes for a student to finish thinking!
    
    [00:15] Student_A
    Ah OK. 
    
    [00:20] Student_A
    So, iyan, finally Stacy finished thinking. And O.M.G. she does not know addition?
